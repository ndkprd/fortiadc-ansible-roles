# fortiadc-ansible-roles

## Descriptions

My collections (?) of Fortinet's FortiADC Ansible roles. All of them based on FortiADC HTTP REST API, utilized by `ansible.builtin.uri` module.

## List of Roles

| Role Name                              | Repository                                                                                  | Workflow                                                                                                                                   |

## Roles Dependency

Because of FortiADC nature, some roles is dependent to another, kinda looks like this:

```
glb_data_centers < glb_servers < glb_vs_pools < glb_hosts
dns_policy < glb_hosts
dns_policy < dns_zones
```

## IaC Implementation

To implement Infrastructure as Code for FortiADC using these roles, you can just directly use the right-most roles from the above dependency diagram, since it will automatically run the dependent role(s) first.

Though to be noted, since I composed these roles for my personal (and corporate) use, I make them to my need, hence why I've only composed DNS-related configuration from FortiADC and not SLB.

## About Idempotency

I tried to make the roles as idempotent as possible. I probably missed some of them (just create an issue if you found one), but most of the time the tasks works like this:

```
if resource is undefined:
    do POST task
if resource is defined AND existing_resource_value != desired_resource_value:
    do PUT task
else
    skip tasks
```

## Limitation

I've only tested these roles against FortiADC running firmware 7.0

## About Tags

Almost all roles have tasks tagged with `debug` on them, which can be used to print out the value before and after each "action" tasks (usually either POST or PUT). If you already sure, you can skip them with `--skip-tags debug` args.
